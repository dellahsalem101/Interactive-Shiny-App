# Interactive Shiny App
This repository contains all major deliverables for my interactive data dashboard project. The goal was to build an R Shiny app that visualizes real-world data through interactive, user-driven dashboards.

## Overview
As the **App Developer**, I:
- Loaded and cleaned CSV data using `readr` and `dplyr`
- Designed a Shiny dashboard to explore the Titanic dataset
- Created reactive visualizations with `ggplot2` that update based on user-selected filters
- Enabled filtering by passenger class and age range for tailored data views
- Developed detailed documentation explaining the appâ€™s features and usage

## Key Deliverables
- [Shiny App](ShinyApp.R) 
- [Project Report](Project%20Report.pdf)
- [Used Dataset](data/train.csv)

## Skills Applied
- R Programming
- Shiny App Development & UI Design
- Data Visualization 
- Reactive Programming & User Input Handling
- Technical Writing & Documentation

## Role & Impact
I developed the entire app from data ingestion to user interface design, focusing on usability and clear visualization. The project demonstrates my ability to build interactive data tools that allow end users to explore datasets dynamically.
